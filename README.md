# php_website
This PHP coded website is constructed using many languages, including HTML, CSS, mySQL, PHP and TWIG templating language. The 
main website consists of various pages demonstrating how using TWIG templating can create websites with minimal coding in HTML. The website is connected to a mySQL database which serves all the information displayed in each table. The PHP backend is constructed using all modern codeing practices and utilises TWIG to display all information returned from the database.
The website has secure logins (Passowrds hashed using the most modern hashing algorithm), user and admin. The admin can edit all profiles, add or remove content and remotely upoad images to add to the gallery.
